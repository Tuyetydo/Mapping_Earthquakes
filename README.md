# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Project
Basil and Sadhana would like me to use my knowledge of JavaScrip, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON to use my earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay.

### Purpose
The purpose is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

- [x] Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- [x] Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- [x] Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
